# Classification 

In this section we have kept all models which were used for training the dolphin classifiation model.

## Models used 
- VGG 16
- Inception Resnet 
- EfficientDet D-0
- EfficientDet D-7


## Augmentations Techniques applied 
- Horizontal Flip 
- Rotation (-20 -> 20%)
- Noise (10%)

## Hyperparameters you can tune  
- Ridge Regression.
- Dropout Regularization.
- You can add your custom layers and see how it perforns i have utilised transfer learning on all trained models.
