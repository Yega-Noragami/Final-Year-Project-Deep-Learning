# Detection 

In this section you can view the models which were used for training and also the final deployment(which is kept inside deploy folder).

## Models used 
- SSD Resnet
- Faster RCNN
- Sacled YOLOv4-CSP
- Scaled YOLOv4-P7


## Deployment 
- I have tried to kept the deployment section independent, and can be easily downloaded. You can perform inference on custom object by traing your YOLOv4-P7 in Darknet Format.
- Change the class path and put your custom model there.
